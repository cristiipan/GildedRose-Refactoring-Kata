# Gilded Rose Refactoring Documentation

## Design Patterns Used
- **Strategy Pattern**: Created independent update strategies for each item type
- **Factory Pattern**: Generated corresponding strategy objects based on item names

## Problems Before Refactoring
1. Excessive nesting (up to 5 levels deep)
2. Code duplication (multiple checks for the same conditions)
3. Difficult to extend (adding new item types required modifying complex if-else structures)

## Improvements After Refactoring
1. Each strategy class has a single responsibility and is easy to understand
2. Adding new items only requires creating new strategy classes without modifying existing code
3. Code readability significantly improved

## Test Results
✅ All tests passed (30-day snapshot testing)

## Optional Extensions
- [x] Implement Conjured item strategy
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Extract common methods to base class

## Design Patterns Applied
- **Strategy Pattern**: Implemented dedicated update strategies for each item type
- **Factory Pattern**: Utilized factory method to instantiate strategy objects based on item names

## Issues Identified in Legacy Code
1. Deep nesting complexity (maximum depth of 5 levels)
2. Redundant conditional checks throughout the codebase
3. Poor extensibility (introducing new item types necessitated modifications to complex conditional logic)

## Post-Refactoring Enhancements
1. Single Responsibility Principle applied - each strategy class maintains clear, focused logic
2. Open-Closed Principle achieved - new item types can be added through extension rather than modification
3. Substantially improved code maintainability and readability

## Testing Validation
✅ All tests passed (30-day snapshot regression testing)

## Future Enhancements
- [x] Implemented Conjured item strategy
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit test coverage
- [ ] Extract shared functionality into base class methods
